# Section-2

## Level-1 

This level is about Detach yo' HEAD

In This level we are going to learn about, how to detach the HEAD state

Detached HEAD means you’ve checked out a specific commit instead of a branch, so any new commits won’t belong to a branch unless you create one.

Here we can see, what goals we have to reach in this level
