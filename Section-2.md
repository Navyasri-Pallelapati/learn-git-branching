# Section-2

## Level-1 

This level is about Detach yo' HEAD.

In This level we are going to learn about, how to detach the HEAD state.

Detached HEAD means you’ve checked out a specific commit instead of a branch, so any new commits won’t belong to a branch unless you create one.

## Level-2

This level is about Relative Refs.

In this level we are going to learn about, how to demonstrates relative references using the caret(^) operator.

**Relative refs** let you refer to commits based on their position from another commit (like `HEAD~1` or `HEAD^`) instead of using full commit hashes.
